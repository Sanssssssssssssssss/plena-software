"""Mid-IR node definitions.

A small dataclass IR sitting between raw TIR and PLENA HLIR. Designed
to make the **lane-fusion rewrite a sequence of mechanical, one-thing-each
passes** instead of the layered Graph-IR-everything approach.

Pipeline (each step is one pass; the IR shape only changes in the
specific ways noted):

  raw tir.PrimFunc
    │
    │  pass_1_fold:  nested for + BufferStore → Elementwise / Reduce / Broadcast
    │  pass_2_mark:  tag dma / btmm gemm / elementwise sites with .marker
    │                (blockIdx still alive throughout)
    │  pass_3_split: pick a blockIdx axis; split it into (number, phase);
    │                grow every non-global buffer by one outer `cluster` dim
    │                — only *add*, never permute.
    │  pass_4_async: wrap each marked op in Async(...)
    │  pass_5_loop:  introduce `for phase in [0, cluster_count)` but break
    │                it into multiple fors at every Async boundary
    │  pass_6_fuse:  collapse `for phase: <single async op>` into
    │                MultiLaneOp(op, dim_map = {cluster_axis: (buf, dim)})
    │  pass_7_perm:  use dim_map to permute the cluster axis into the
    │                physical-layout slot per buffer
    │
  mid_ir ready

    ``params`` are param buffers (always global / HBM). ``allocs`` are
    on-chip buffers the kernel allocates. ``body`` is the sequence of
    statements at the kernel's grid scope.

    ``lane_axes`` records the kernel author's
    ``T.func_attr({"plena.lane_axis": ["by"]})`` declaration so pass_3
    knows which blockIdx(es) to split. Multi-axis cluster is supported
    from day one: a kernel can declare ``["by", "q_block"]`` to
    cluster-fuse both. Each axis gets its own cluster_count entry, in
    the same order. ``cluster_counts`` is filled in by pass_3
    (typically = ``[lane_count]`` = ``[MLEN / btmm_hlen]``).

    Mid-IR output preserves blockIdx — see ``For`` docstring. The
    body's outermost layer is typically a chain of ``For(thread_tag=
    "blockIdx.*")`` for both untouched grid axes and the *_number
    halves of split lane axes.
