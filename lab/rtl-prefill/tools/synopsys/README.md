```
## Usage
Before running the synthesis, you will need to cd into the synopsys directory.
```
cd <path to the project>/tools/synopsys
```
`module_dc.tcl` and `run_module_dc.sh` are used to run the unit level synthesis.
`dc.tcl` and `run_dc.sh` are used to run the top level synthesis.

For unit level synthesis, every time you will need to modify the `module_dc.tcl` script to include the module you want to synthesize. 

**Note**: It would be better to link the src directory to and only to the related module. Or the possible bugs from other modules will be caught and stop the synthesis process.

### Run debug (Check only)
```
bash run_debug.sh
```

### Run synthesis
```
bash run_dc.sh
```
