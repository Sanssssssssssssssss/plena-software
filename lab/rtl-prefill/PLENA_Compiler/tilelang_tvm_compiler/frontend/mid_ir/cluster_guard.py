"""Helper: should the cluster pipeline (pass_3 onwards) run on this MidFunc?

Two skip conditions, either alone is enough:

  1. ``MidFunc.lane_axes`` is empty — kernel didn't declare any axis
     for cluster fusion. Treat as "this kernel doesn't need cluster",
     no error.
  2. Every non-global buffer's last dim is already >= MLEN.
     A HW vector op is MLEN-wide; if every on-chip buffer already
     covers a full vector along its trailing axis, one lane fills
     a single instruction by itself — cluster fusion buys nothing.

The cluster passes (split / distribute_cluster / async_wrap / view /
fuse) all check this guard at entry and no-op if either condition
holds.
