# Docker Setup for PLENA Simulator

This directory contains Docker configuration that encapsulates the Nix development environment.

## Files

- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build with dev, builder, and runtime targets
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service definitions and volume management

## Quick Start

From the repository root:

```bash
# Build and enter development environment
just docker-dev

# Or manually:
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build dev
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d dev
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec dev bash
```

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `just docker-build-dev` | Build development image |
| `just docker-build-all` | Build all images |
| `just docker-dev` | Start and enter dev container |
| `just docker-run <cmd>` | Run command in dev environment |
| `just docker-test <recipe> [args...]` | Run a just recipe (with args) in Docker |
| `just docker-down` | Stop containers |

## Running Tests

Run any `just` recipe inside the container with `docker-test`. The recipe name and
its arguments are forwarded verbatim, so multi-word invocations work:

```bash
just docker-test test-aten-linear            # run the ATen linear test
just docker-test test-aten-linear --mlen 128 # ...with args
just docker-test build-emulator linear       # rebuild env + emulator for a target
```

The first emulator test compiles the release binary
(`transactional_emulator/target/release/transactional_emulator`) automatically — a
one-time Rust build of a few minutes. It lives in the bind-mounted repo, so it
persists on the host and later runs reuse it.

If a test fails, it prints the traceback and exits non-zero — it will **not** drop
into an interactive `pdb` prompt when run non-interactively (e.g. in Docker or CI).

## Build Targets

### dev (default)
Full development environment with:
- Nix flake environment
- Python 3.12 + all dependencies
- Rust toolchain
- All build tools (gcc, clang, cmake, etc.)

### builder
CI/CD build stage that compiles the transactional emulator via `nix build`.

### runtime
Minimal image containing only the built emulator binary and Python analytical models.

## CUDA Support

For GPU-enabled development:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --profile cuda up -d dev-cuda
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec dev-cuda bash
```

## Persistent Volumes

The setup uses named volumes to persist:
- `plena-nix-store` - Nix store for faster rebuilds
- `plena-cargo-cache` - Rust/Cargo build cache
- `plena-venv-cache` - Python virtual environment

To clean all caches: `just docker-clean`
