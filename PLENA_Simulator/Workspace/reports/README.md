# PLENA Modeling and Validation Reports

This directory is the canonical location for human-readable modeling and
validation reports produced in the PLENA Simulator workspace. Machine-readable
calibration artifacts remain next to the implementation that consumes them.

## Status Map

Interpret reports using these categories:

### Current canonical

- `system_validation_status.md`: authoritative integrated stack and claim
  boundary.
- `hbm_v4/hbm_dma_service_v4_full_report.md`: current single-chip
  production-DMA memory surrogate.
- `area/precision_aware_area_model_v4.md`: current pre-layout area proxy.
- `power/rtl_activity_power_candidate_v2.md` and
  `power/ideal_hierarchical_clock_gating_v1.md`: current architecture-level
  system-energy components and ideal/ungated clock bounds.
- `compiler/compact_stats_selector_overwrite_v1.md`,
  `compiler/current_stack_implementation_comparison_20260727.md`,
  `compiler/partial_resident_kv_ideal_dual_port_dse.md`,
  `compiler/unified_affine_ffn_loop_lowering_v2.md`, and
  `compiler/moe_compiler_optimization_v2.md`: current compiler/hardware
  architecture path.
- `dse/tile_aware_multichip_lineage_audit_v4.md`: current corrected
  multi-chip controlled results. For N>1, HBM V4 is analytical traffic
  scaling rather than distributed request-manifest replay.

### Historical but valid

Staged compiler reports, `rtl-v1` timing reports, RTL-v2/v3 reports,
fixed-balanced MoE latency, DSE search/compression reports, and the legacy
analytic comparison remain valid for their stated source state and A/B
question. Their headline latency values are not current end-to-end results.

### Superseded

- `dse/factorized_multichip_model_v2.md` and the earlier ideal-linear
  multi-chip reports are reproducibility baselines under
  `analytic_models.legacy`; they are not selectable by the formal DSE CLI.
- `dse/tile_aware_multichip_model_v3.md` documents the initial implementation,
  but its original result tables are superseded by the v4 lineage audit.
- `compiler/packed_gqa_streaming_kmajor_agu_v2.md` is mixed-status:
  streaming/K-major remain current, while AGU-v2 is retired from the code.
- `power/rtl_activity_power_candidate_v1.md` is a rejected calibration
  candidate retained for failure analysis.

### Invalidated numeric claims

The old long-context values `TP4 x CP4 = 5.491 s` and
`TP1 x CP16 = 2.413 s` came from incomplete final-schedule lineage and must
not be reused. The corrected controlled values and explanation are in
`dse/tile_aware_multichip_lineage_audit_v4.md`.

Across every category, `CLOCK_PERIOD_PS=1000` is only a cycle-to-time
conversion assumption. Broadcast QK timing is nonzero but remains
`broadcast_rtl_unvalidated`; ideal-II1 and ideal hierarchical clock gating are
architectural assumptions, not cycle-exact or timing-closed RTL claims.

## Claim Policy

The reports distinguish four different validation levels:

1. Unit and request-geometry parity tests.
2. Held-out microbenchmark prediction error.
3. Production Qwen trace validation.
4. Full-system or DSE-level validation.

A result at one level must not be presented as evidence for a stronger level.
In particular:

- The 1 ns clock conversion is a reporting assumption, not an RTL timing
  closure result.
- The HBM V4 model is a post-hoc production-DMA service surrogate, not online
  cross-queue Ramulator co-simulation.
- Scheduled makespan error can be much smaller than HBM work error when a
  workload is compute-bound.
- A CostEmitter stage is a compiler semantic region containing one or more
  kernels. `sum(max(stage compute, stage memory))` can overestimate a scheduled
  timeline when work overlaps across stage boundaries; it is not a universal
  roofline lower bound.
- Numerical execution and the existing correctness gate were not changed by
  either latency-modeling effort.
