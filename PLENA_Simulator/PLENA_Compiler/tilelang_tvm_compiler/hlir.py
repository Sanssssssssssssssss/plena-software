"""HLIR -- the small, pass-friendly IR that flows between PLENA passes.

Why a tiny custom IR (rather than re-walking TIR each pass):
    - we need to attach pass-specific state (resolved addresses, register
      hints, scheduling info) to ops and buffers
    - TIR doesn't easily carry that without dialect machinery
    - keeping the IR small (fewer than ten op kinds for now) means each
      pass is a single-file Python function, easy to read and test

Op kinds intentionally mirror our `intrinsics` registry one-to-one:
each `plena.<x>` extern call in TIR becomes one HLIR Op with kind=<x>.
That keeps the codegen pass mechanical -- no clever rewrites yet.

    A buffer with logical shape ``(B, S, H, D)`` whose ``S`` and/or ``D``
    overflow MLEN gets stored physically as a 7D layout:

        (D_TILES, S_TILES, H_GROUPS, B,   MLEN, LANE_COUNT, D_INNER)
        └─────── outer tile index ───────┘ └──── inner per-tile ──┘

    where:
        S_TILES  = ceildiv(S, MLEN)
        D_TILES  = ceildiv(D, MLEN)              if D > MLEN else 1
        D_INNER  = MLEN if D > MLEN else min(D, MLEN)
        H_GROUPS = ceildiv(H, LANE_COUNT)
        LANE_COUNT determined by D_INNER:
            * D_INNER == MLEN  → LANE_COUNT = 1
            * D_INNER  < MLEN  → LANE_COUNT = MLEN // D_INNER
                                  (typically MLEN // HLEN, hardware-dependent)

    Each per-tile inner block ``(MLEN, LANE_COUNT, D_INNER)`` is exactly
    one ``H_LOAD_V`` worth of data. The outer ``(D_TILES, S_TILES,
    H_GROUPS, B)`` is the tile grid; multi-tile DMAs walk it in
    row-major (D_TILE outermost so D_TILES > 1 cases stay contiguous in
    the natural way).

    Logical (b, s, h, d) → physical 7D:
        d_tile  = d // MLEN          d_inner = d %  MLEN
        s_tile  = s // MLEN          s_inner = s %  MLEN
        h_grp   = h // LANE_COUNT    lane    = h %  LANE_COUNT
    Physical flat offset:
        d_tile  * (S_TILES * H_GROUPS * B * MLEN * LANE_COUNT * D_INNER)
      + s_tile  * (H_GROUPS * B * MLEN * LANE_COUNT * D_INNER)
      + h_grp   * (B * MLEN * LANE_COUNT * D_INNER)

      + s_inner * (LANE_COUNT * D_INNER)
      + lane    * D_INNER
      + d_inner

    Total physical element count equals logical numel — the layout is
